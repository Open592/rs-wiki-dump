# RS-Wiki-Dump

This repo will hold tools used for scraping / "dumping" Runescape wiki article content.

The goal will be to create a tool which can answer natual language questions about Runescape
for help with developing the Open592 project.

The issue we are trying to solve is that even if we have all this information archived, how
do you actually use it effectively? Right now it's too time consuming to try and find small
details.

In the future we will combine the wiki's information with other sources of historical information
including:

- Text scraped from old screenshots
- Forum posts
- etc.
